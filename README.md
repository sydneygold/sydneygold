Hey! My name is Sydney and I'm a fullstack software developer with a preference for frontend development and a passion for innovative and responsive design. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter, React Native, Typescript.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating a mobile app in Flutter called TherapySwipe! More on that soon.
- 😀 I like to play video games, make digital art, read, and make coffee/tea recipes in my free time.
- 💬 Ask me about the third wave coffee industry. Or anything about tea. I can talk about it for hours.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've designed tattoos, prints, and used to pursue competitive barista-ing!
