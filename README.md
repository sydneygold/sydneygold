Hey! My name is Verance and I'm a fullstack software developer with a preference for frontend development and a passion for innovative and responsive design. I'm from Dallas, TX moved transplanted to Denver, CO to escape the summer heat and some of my hobbies are making digital art, reading comics, playing video games, and working on getting my low elevation lungs up to par on nature hikes. I'd love to connect!   

## some fun facts!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter, React Native, and Typescript.
- 🔭 My most recent project is a mobile app in Flutter called Kettle Whistle! An app for coffee and tea recipes I used to test my skills in Flutter.

- 💬 Ask me about the third wave coffee industry. Or anything about tea. I can talk about it for hours.
- ⚡ I've designed tattoos, prints, and used to pursue competitive barista-ing! (It's a thing, look it up it's awesome)
